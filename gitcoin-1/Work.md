# Work Notes
Basically I will be creating a godwoke account on the Nervos EVM layer 2 Testnet. This is the first step  layer 1 blockchain before interacting with EVM contract layer 2. This basically Dapp smart contract language. 

first step is going to create an account on the testnet nervos SKB layer 1 blockchain and fund it with some CKBytes and export the private key 

secound step is going to be how to depost CKbytes from layer 1 to layer 2 which godwoken. This is basically going to be a way for a user to lock up their CKByte and be able to be use to pay for "state rent"
